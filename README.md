# Getting Started with My Tune Space

Welcome to My Tune Space! This project was kickstarted with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tool that allows us to focus on writing code rather than setting up build environments.

## Available Scripts

Within the My Tune Space project directory, you have access to several commands:

### `npm start`

This command fires up the app in development mode. To check it out, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. You'll see the app live, and it will automatically reload if you make edits. Any lint errors will be shown in the console, keeping your code clean.

### `npm test`

By running this command, you initiate the test runner in an interactive watch mode. For detailed instructions on running tests, visit the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This builds the app for production, saving it to the `build` folder. It ensures React is bundled in production mode, optimizing the build for the best performance - your app becomes faster, the build size is reduced, and files are given hashes for cache control. Your My Tune Space app is then ready to be deployed to the world!

For deployment details, refer to the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Important: `eject` is irreversible.** If you decide to `eject`, there's no turning back. If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices provided by Create React App, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and directly move all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project. This gives you complete control, but from this point on, you're on your own. You will need to manage these files and dependencies yourself.

Although `eject` is available, it's recommended to use the pre-configured setup for as long as it meets your project's needs. The setup is ideal for small to medium deployments, and you're encouraged not to feel compelled to use `eject`.
